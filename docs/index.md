# Miking Documentation

Miking is a meta-language system for creating embedded languages, and this site holds its documentation.

We are currently in the process of restructuring our documentation (see [here](https://documentation.divio.com/) for more information on the intent), thus some information can be found in the first four categories below (where they should be) and some can be found in the fifth category.

## Content

- [Tutorials](./tutorials) are meant for initial learning, and give step-by-step instructions for solving small, self-contained tasks.
- [How-to guides](./how-to-guides) give step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish commonly occurring tasks or solve problems.
- The [Reference](./reference) documents the more technical details of the project: APIs, syntax, semantics, etc.
- [Explanations](./explanations) give more theoretical descriptions of concepts used in the Miking project, how they relate, and why they are designed the way they are.


## Old Content

The old documentation can be found here while the documentation restructuring is in progress:

- The [Miking](/miking-readme) README.
- The [Miking DPPL](/miking-dppl-readme) README.
